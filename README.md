# Car Racing Game (Flask + Pygame)

## Description  
This is a simple yet engaging car racing game built using **Pygame** for game mechanics and **Flask** to serve it as a web application. The objective is to navigate a car along a road while avoiding randomly appearing obstacles. As the game progresses, the speed increases, making it more challenging. The game ends if the car collides with an obstacle.  

## Features  
✅ **Smooth Car Movement** – Control the car using arrow keys.  
✅ **Dynamic Environment** – A moving road background with randomly spawning obstacles.  
✅ **Collision Detection** – The game ends upon hitting an obstacle.  
✅ **Score Tracking** – Your score increases the longer you survive.  
✅ **Flask Integration** – Play the game directly in a web browser.
